# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

Your answer: In object-oriented programming, such as Ruby, everything is an object. With these objects you can attach any number of methods to them to make the code do what you want. Where as functional programming consists of creating functions and then establishing methods inside of the function.

Researched answer: object-oriented programming used objects and methods to construct the code. functional programming is focused on composing functions. These functionas can be stored in a variable, passed as an argument or returned from a function.

2. What is the difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby?

Your answer: An integer in Ruby is simply a number. A float, is also a number however it has a decimal, for example pi 3.14 would be a float in Ruby.

Researched answer: Integers and floats are both a form of numerical data. The difference is that a float is a number with a decimal. A integer is a whole number.

3. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

Your answer: Implicit returns means that a function will be returned without the need of putting "return" before the actual return. It automatically send the return at the end of the function.

Researched answer: In ruby, every block will retun the value of the last line automatically, without the need for the keyword "return".

4. What is a block in Ruby?

Your answer: A block in Ruby, refers to a block of code. This is where you input your functions and methods etc, that is all contained in a block. 

Researched answer: A block is the same as a method. However, it doesn't belong to an object. Blocks can accept an argument and return a value.

1. How do you extract a value in a Ruby hash?

Your answer: You would use the 'do' method to extract from the key value pair. The syntax to extract a value in a Ruby hash is "#{value}". The values will have been predefined and stored within a key.

Researched answer: The curly braces contain key value pairs. The values are assigned into keys. Calling the hash followed by a key name within brackets grabs the value associated with that key.
